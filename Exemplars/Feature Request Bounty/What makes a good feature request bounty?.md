# What makes a good feature request bounty? 
A good feature request bounty is one that consisely, yet thoroughly, explains desired additions to a platform or idea. In general terms, these are Improvement issues and are usually found as Traditional project types (although this is not set in stone). These bounties generally require the most explanation, since they involve a prospective bounty hunter working towards a new addition. 

## What is a feature request bounty?
A feature request bounty is essentially a bounty in which bounty hunters are rewarded for the addition or development of features within a platform, application, or task. It is not an open-ended request, and usually must adhere to specific guidelines outlined in the task. 

## What should be included in a feature request bounty?
Since feature request bounties have such a wide scope, there are various criterion which can be included to work towards an effective bounty description: 

## User story
A user story is a great way of informing a prospective bounty hunter regarding your task. Often times, a feature request focuses around an existing application or idea, and there is no better way to communicate this then to walk the applicant through the end-goal. For example:

```
As a funder, I would like [your-task]. 
Currently, users follow [x] roadmap through the application, 
but I'd like to improve this by having a feature made to move to [y] roadmap.
```

### Current Behaviour
Current behaviour essentially outlines your design, architecture, or idea as it currently stands. This gives a prospect an outlook into what sort of base stage they are working with. For example:

```
Currently, on the [some-section] section of the [some-page] page, 
when the user types in a value it shows a green checkmark.
```

### Wanted Behaviour
Wanted behaviour outlines your expected result. It tells the bounty hunter exactly what you want. In the case of a feature, this section would have information regarding your feature addition guidelines, desired feature programming stack, content usage policies, and information about code integration specifics. For example: 

```
As discussed previously in Current behaviour, when the user types in a value it shows a green checkmark. 
We want a developer to develop the functionality for a new blue checkmark in accordance to our [feature-addition-guidelines].
We are looking for submission in [your-stack], in accordance to our [content-integration-policies].
Here are some more feature-specifics, screenshots, etc.:
```

### Definition of done
Define your completed feature bounty. At the end of the day, what is it that you want completed, and how will you assess that the bounty hunter has met your expecations?

```
You have completed this bounty when: 
1. The checkmark now has the functionality to be blue.
```

### Submission 
Finally, submission details the method of how you want prospective bounty hunters to submit their work. Unlike others, in the case of feature bounties, using a version control platform is recommended. For example:

```
To submit, make a pull request on the Github repository.
```
