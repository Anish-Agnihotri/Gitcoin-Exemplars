# What makes a good bug bounty? 
A good bug bounty is one that is consice, to the point, and provides an adequate amount of detail in regards to the problem(s) that needs to be found and resolved. Since a majority of bug bounties are retroactive, and are not geared towards solving a specific problem, but, rather hunting for one, it is essential to include as much information as possible to guide a bounty hunter. 

## What is a bug bounty?
A bug bounty is essentially a bounty in which bounty hunters are rewarded for finding bugs or vulnerabilities within a platform, application, or task. It is an open-ended request which usually accepts multiple entries. 

## What should be included in a bug bounty?
Since bug bounties have such a wide scope, there are various criterion which can be included to work towards an effective bounty description: 

### Task
The task is the job at hand. This is a simple breif that describes the purpose of your bounty. For example:

```
The task is to find functionality bugs in [your-application]. 
We are looking for [desired-behavior] behavior or unexpected errors occuring.
```
### Application details
The application details describes any external links, dependencies, or requirements that may need to be referenced for the task. For example: 

```
To complete the task, please view external instructions at [your-external-instructions].
Note, [compiling|developing|setting up] will be involved.
```

### Scope
The scope details your bounties submission criteria. Essentially, it describes what sort of output you are looking for. For example: 

```
The purpose of this bounty is to find UI bugs within the client application.
```

### Compensation
The compensation details your compensation structure for bug submissions. For example:

```
~ Critical functionality misbehavior: 0.4 ETH 
~ Unexpected functionality misbehavior: 0.1 ETH 
~ Unexpected Errors: 0.08 ETH
```

### Submission
Finally, submission details the method of how you want prospective bounty hunters to submit their work. With the security concern of publically reporting bugs, it's essential to make certain you have a secure method of submission. For example:

```
Please email any findings to someone@someonescompany.com
```
