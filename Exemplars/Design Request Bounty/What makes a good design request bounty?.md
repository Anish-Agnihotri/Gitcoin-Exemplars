# What makes a good design request bounty? 
A good design request bounty is one that is consice, to the point, and provides an adequate amount of detail in regards to the design task that needs to be completed. Since a majority of design bounties are open-ended and don't generally follow the rules of programming bounties, it is essential to include as much information as possible to guide a bounty hunter.

## What is a design request bounty?
A design request bounty is essentially a request for help in designing various aspects of a project. Common design requests feature tasks in relation to architectures, flows, wireframes, and just general visual designs. Although such bounties are most usually Traditional project types, they can often be found as Contests and Cooperative as well. 

## What should be included in a design request bounty?
Since design request bounties have such a wide scope, there are various criterion which can be included to work towards an effective bounty description: 

### User story
Specific to design request bounties, a user story is a great way of informing a prospective bounty hunter regarding your task. Often times, a design request focuses around an existing application or idea, and there is no better way to communicate this then to walk the applicant through the end-goal. For example:

```
As a funder, I would like [your-task]. 
Currently, users follow [x] roadmap through the application, 
but I'd like to improve this by having a design made to move to [y] roadmap.
```

### Current behaviour
Current behaviour essentially outlines your design, architecture, or idea as it currently stands. This gives a prospect an outlook into what sort of base stage they are working with. For example:

```
Currently, on the [some-section] section of the [some-page] page, 
when the user types in a value it shows a green checkmark.
```

### Wanted behaviour
Wanted behaviour outlines your expected result. It tells the bounty hunter exactly what you want. In the case of a design, this section would have information regarding your design guidelines, desired submission format, content usage policies, and information about design-specifics.

```
As discussed previously in Current behaviour, when the user types in a value it shows a green checkmark. 
We want a designer to design a new blue checkmark to adhere to our [design-guidelines].
We are looking for submission in [your-format], in accordance to our [content-usage-policies].
Here are some more design-specifics:
```

### Compensation
The compensation details your compensation structure for a design submissions. Specifically to design bounties, it is essential to include information regarding content usage and ownership (important for when working with vector images, designs, etc.). For example:

```
Completed design bounty will be rewarded with 100ETH. 
All content approved and paid for will become intellectual property of [your name/organization name].
```

### Definition of done
Define your completed design bounty. At the end of the day, what is it that you want completed, and how will you assess that the bounty hunter has met your expecations?

```
You have completed this bounty when: 
1. The checkmark is now blue.
```

### Submission
Finally, submission details the method of how you want prospective bounty hunters to submit their work. With the concern of various design formats, etc., it's essential to make certain you have an appropriate method of submission. For example:

```
Please email completed designs to someone@someonescompany.com
```
